I wanted to build an interactive web app that lets you explore episode-level ratings across seasons for your favorite TV shows. 

Built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) and [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/), it uses data from the [TVMaze API](https://www.tvmaze.com/api) to generate dynamic heatmaps, helping  visualize which seasons soared — and which episodes flopped.

Whether you’re trying to decide where to pick up a long-running series, or just want to settle a debate over which season of [Grey’s Anatomy](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0413573/) peaked, this tool gives you the insights — without the spoilers.

Link to the [Streamlit app](http://tvshowratings.streamlit.app) and [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mekgurnani/tvshow_ratings/tree/main) developed to build this.
